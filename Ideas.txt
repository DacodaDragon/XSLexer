IMPLEMENTATIONS>
	DataFile special list (with predetermined name like "Settings>" or "Flags>" for containing settings that aren't part of the actual ruleset)
		(e.g. for structurizer an IgnoreType:string[] setting would be nice instead of hardcoding what types there are)
	DataFile flags (instead of Keyname: True, just have !Keyname or +Keyname)
	Structurizer Tag "Ref:string[]" for containing a list of other tags it could be.
		(eg. Expression> Ref: FuncCall|ExprBodyOp|Value)
	LogicCheck Implementation: 
		I was thinking about making a Lua interface (Library?)
		since that stuff gets more complex than just a simple tokenbased
		ruleset. Lua has some basic familiarity to people already, might be 
		intresting. Maybe we can support multiple in the future?
		
OPTIMIZATION:
	Preparsed DataValue.value for TokenReplacer
	Preparsed DataValue.value for Structurizer
	DataSet.Resolve() use type-hash for lookup instead of strings
