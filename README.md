# XSLexer
An application to tokenize and grammar check the XS scripting language, used for random map generation, AI and other functionality. This is a still ongoing project in preparation for XS pre-processing to add fixed sized arrays and more lenient code syntax while staying compatible with core XS.

# WHAT I LEARNED SO FAR
 - Usage of REGEX
 - When done using REGEX, either use compiled REGEX statements or make create your own implementation for a big performance boost.

# ROADMAP

 - [x] Tokenize XS Code
 - [ ] Parse XS Grammar/Syntax
 - [ ] Add Arrays
 - [ ] Add Simple TriggerCode Injection Syntax
 - [ ] Add MathLibrary to automatically implement math functions if required by code
